<h1>The svc program</h1>
<tt>svc</tt>
controls services
monitored by <a href="supervise.html">supervise</a>.
<h2>Interface</h2>
<pre>
     svc <i>opts</i> <i>services</i>
</pre>
<p>
<tt><i>opts</i></tt> is a series of getopt-style options.
<tt><i>services</i></tt> consists of any number of arguments,
each argument naming a directory used by <tt>supervise</tt>.
<p>
<tt>svc</tt> applies all the options to each service in turn.
Here are the options:
<ul>
<li><tt>-u</tt>: Up.
If the service is not running, start it.
If the service stops, restart it.
<li><tt>-d</tt>: Down.
If the service is running, send it a TERM signal and then a CONT signal.
After it stops, do not restart it.
<li><tt>-o</tt>: Once.
If the service is not running, start it.
Do not restart it if it stops.
<li><tt>-p</tt>: Pause.
Send the service a STOP signal.
<li><tt>-c</tt>: Continue.
Send the service a CONT signal.
<li><tt>-h</tt>: Hangup.
Send the service a HUP signal.
<li><tt>-a</tt>: Alarm.
Send the service an ALRM signal.
<li><tt>-i</tt>: Interrupt.
Send the service an INT signal.
<li><tt>-t</tt>: Terminate.
Send the service a TERM signal.
<li><tt>-k</tt>: Kill.
Send the service a KILL signal.
<li><tt>-x</tt>: Exit.
<tt>supervise</tt> will exit as soon as the service is down.
If you use this option on a stable system,
you're doing something wrong;
<tt>supervise</tt> is designed to run forever.
