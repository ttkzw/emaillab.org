<h1>Upgrading from previous versions of daemontools</h1>
<h2>0.53 to 0.60 or 0.61</h2>
<tt>supervise</tt> no longer takes a program name as an argument.
Instead it switches to the given directory and starts <tt>./run</tt>.
The options have disappeared;
if you do not want <tt>./run</tt> to be started immediately,
touch <tt>./down</tt>.
<p>
The <tt>testfilelock</tt> program is gone.
You can use <tt>svok</tt> to check reliably
whether <tt>supervise</tt> is running.
<p>
<tt>cyclog</tt>, <tt>fifo</tt>, <tt>errorsto</tt> and <tt>usually</tt>
have been replaced by <tt>multilog</tt>,
which has built-in line selection and timestamping.
<p>
<tt>accustamp</tt> and <tt>tailocal</tt>
have been replaced by <tt>tai64n</tt> and <tt>tai64nlocal</tt>,
with new time formats designed to encourage Y2038-compliant code.
<p>
<tt>setuser</tt> is now called <tt>setuidgid</tt>.
<h2>0.61 to 0.70</h2>
There are many internal changes.
There are two new utilities,
<tt>setlock</tt> (from the <tt>serialmail</tt> package)
and <tt>envdir</tt>.
<tt>svscan</tt> now allows a command-line <tt>/service</tt> argument.
